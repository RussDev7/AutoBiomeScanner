### Why is this script needed?
Here is an example of a `stony_shore` biome being successfully found on my personal world.

When using [terralith] along side [terratonic], you can find fairly quickly that `stony_shore` become near to none. The reason for this is because Terralith makes these biomes relatively tiny, then combine that with Terratonic's further smoothing mechanics, the stony_shore biome gets completely flattened over and eradicated. So this makes stony_shore biomes one of the rarest biomes under these two mods.

### How it works?
This script performs `canvas` click movements through javascript that follow a spiral type pattern. Each movement or "step" moves at half your windows height in all directions. This ensures a smooth transition throughout all **XY** movements.

After each step, the script then scans each `canvas` element for a specified color, and if none is found, deletes the `canvas` element and Illiterate through all remaining `canvas` elements before doing a new step.
